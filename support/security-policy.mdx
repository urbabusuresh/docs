description: Security practices and principles followed in RaptrOnix.
---

This Security Policy outlines the technical and organizational measures implemented to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data processed within **RaptrOnix**, the internal API testing tool used exclusively within our organization's VPN.

RaptrOnix is not accessible from the public internet and operates entirely within secure, enterprise-controlled infrastructure.

# **1. Access Control**

- Access to RaptrOnix is restricted to authorized employees only.
- All access requires authentication via:
  - Microsoft Azure Active Directory (SSO)
  - Google Workspace OAuth
  - Verified corporate email domains
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enforced where applicable.
- Session timeouts and idle logout mechanisms are in place to prevent misuse.

# **2. Network and Infrastructure Security**

- RaptrOnix is deployed within a **secure VPN environment**.
- All communication is encrypted using **TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS)**.
- Internal firewalls restrict access to whitelisted IP ranges.
- Data is stored on servers compliant with organizational security baselines.
- Backups are encrypted and rotated according to IT policy.

# **3. Application Security**

- Secure coding practices are followed, including input sanitization and output encoding.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented for different features/modules.
- Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing are performed.
- Dependency libraries are reviewed and patched regularly via automated tooling.

# **4. Data Security and Retention**

- All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Logs and API test payloads are stored for diagnostic purposes with time-bound retention (up to 90 days).
- No personal or confidential customer data should be entered into the tool.
- Retention schedules are enforced automatically, and expired data is purged.

# **5. Monitoring and Auditing**

- User actions are logged for traceability and compliance.
- Security event logs are monitored via internal SIEM systems.
- Alerts are triggered for abnormal login attempts, failed authentications, and unusual usage patterns.

# **6. Incident Response**

- A formal incident response plan is in place.
- Any suspected data breach or system compromise must be reported to the **IT Security Team** immediately.
- Incidents are tracked, investigated, and documented with root cause analysis and corrective action.

# **7. Employee Access and Training**

- Only designated development and DevOps teams have administrative access.
- Developers and system operators receive periodic security training.
- Least privilege principles are applied to all user roles.

# **8. Third-Party Integrations**

- RaptrOnix only integrates with third-party tools approved by internal , such as:
  - Microsoft Authentication (Azure AD)
- All data shared with third-party services complies with internal privacy and data protection policies.

# **9. Business Continuity**

- Redundant systems and automated backups support high availability.
- Disaster recovery processes are tested periodically.
- Maintenance and patching schedules are managed via DevSecOps pipelines.

# **10. Reporting Security Issues**

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability or security issue in RaptrOnix, please contact the internal security team 

We encourage responsible disclosure and will investigate all reported concerns promptly.
