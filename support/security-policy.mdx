## Reporting a security vulnerability

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the RaptrOnix team.

The primary security point of contact from RaptrOnix team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Incident response process

In case an incident is discovered or reported, we will follow the following  process to contain, respond, and remediate:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be deployed as fast as possible to production.
