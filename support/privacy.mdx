* **Other data** not specifically listed here will be used as described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.

**Third-party sources**. We may combine personal information we receive from you with personal information falling within one of the categories identified above that we obtain from other sources, such as:

* **Public sources, such as government agencies, public records, social media platforms, and other publicly available sources.**

‍  
**Automatic data collection.** We or our service providers may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Service, our communications, and other online services, such as:

* **Device data**, such as your computer or mobile device's operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.  
* **Online activity data**, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing the Service, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times and duration of access, and whether you have opened our emails or clicked links within them.  
* **Precise geolocation/Location data** when you authorize (our mobile application/Service) to access your device's location.  
* **Communication interaction data** such as your interactions with our email or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) – we may do this through the use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails. 

**Data about others**. We may offer features that help users invite their friends or contacts to use the Service, and we may collect contact details about these invitees so we can deliver their invitations. It's also possible to include information about third parties in your prompts or other information that you upload. Please do not refer someone to us or share their contact details or personal information with us unless you have their permission to do so.

## **Cookies and similar technologies.**

Some of the automatic collection described above is facilitated by the following technologies:

* **Cookies** are small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers to record users' web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites include both “session cookies” that are deleted when a session ends, “persistent cookies” that remain longer, “first party” cookies that we place, and “third party” cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place.   
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5, provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.   
* **Chat technologies**, such as those provided by Crisp employ cookies and software code to operate the chat features that you can use to communicate with us through the Service.  Crisp and other third parties may access and use information about webpages visited on our website, your IP address, your general geographic information (e.g., city, state), and other personal information you share through online chats for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  
* **Session-replay technologies,** such as those provided by PostHog employ software code to record users' interactions with the Services in a manner that allows us to watch video replays of those user sessions. The replays include users' clicks, taps, mouse movements, scrolls, and keystrokes/key touches during those sessions. These replays help us diagnose usability problems and identify areas for improvement. You can learn more about PostHog and how to opt out of session recording by PostHog at https://posthog.com/privacy.  
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

* **Mobile settings.** Use your mobile device settings to limit the use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.

You will need to apply these opt-out settings on each device and browser from which you wish to limit the use of your information for interest-based advertising purposes.

We cannot offer any assurances as to whether the companies we work with participate in the opt-out programs described above.

**Do Not Track.** Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
