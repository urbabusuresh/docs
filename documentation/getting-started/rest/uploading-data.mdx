APIs can also be used to upload encoded content to a server. This is usually done with `PUT` or `POST` methods.

The most common content types are:

- `application/json`: for content in JSON format
- `multipart/form-data`: for uploading encoded files
- `application/octet-stream`: for uploading binary data directly

## Uploading a file

To upload a file, the data you send in a `POST` request must be of the content types `application/x-www-form-encoded` and `multipart/form-data`.

## Uploading an image

Let's take a look at **uploading an image** file to an API using wso2apisuite:

1. Select the `POST` HTTP method and set your API Endpoint URL.
2. Add the necessary headers.
3. To add your image file click in the body tab and select `multipart/form-data` in the content-type dropdown.
4. Give your file a name and click on `choose files` to select your file.
5. Click "**Send**" to upload your file.

The <Icon icon="pen-to-square" iconType="solid" />  **Bulk Edit** feature is available for `multipart/form-data` as well. Instead of adding or editing key-value pairs one by one, you can now manage them all at once.

### Set Content Type for Specific Parameters in `multipart/form-data`

When sending multiple types of data in a single request using `multipart/form-data`, you can assign a specific content type to each parameter in wso2apisuite. Here's how:

1. Go to the **Body** tab and select `multipart/form-data` from the **Content Type** dropdown.
2. Add the required data for your request by uploading files or entering values.
3. To specify content types for parameters, enable the **"Show Content Type"** option. Then, choose the appropriate content type for each parameter (e.g., `text/plain` for plain text, `image/png` for a PNG image or `application/json` for JSON data).
4. Click **Send** to submit the multipart data, with each parameter using its specified content type.

## Uploading Binary Data

When uploading binary files, you may want to send raw binary data instead of files in a multipart form. This is typically done using the `application/octet-stream` content type. Follow these steps to upload binary data:

1. Select the **POST** or **PUT** HTTP method and set your API Endpoint URL.
2. In the **Body** tab, select `application/octet-stream` from the **Content Type** dropdown.
3. Upload your binary data by selecting the file from your local machine.
4. Click **Send** to upload the binary data.

<Note> Currently, the **wso2apisuite Desktop App** does **NOT** support uploading **Binary files** directly as request bodies for APIs. </Note>
