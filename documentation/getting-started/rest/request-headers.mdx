Request Headers are key-value pairs that the client sends to the server with an HTTP request. These headers carry extra details about your request, helping the server understand its context and tailor the response to fit.

## Headers Tab

In wso2apisuite, you can easily set and manage request headers using the **Headers tab**. This tab allows you to define **`key-value`** pairs, and you can also add a **`description`** for each header to keep track of its purpose.

Here are a few common headers you might set:

| **Header**        | **Description**                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authorization** | Used for passing credentials, such as tokens, to authenticate the client with the server. |
| **Content-Type**  | Indicates the format of the data being sent, like `application/json`.                     |
| **Accept**        | Tells the server what media types the client can handle in the response.                  |
| **Cache-Control** | Controls caching behavior in both requests and responses.                                 |
| **User-Agent**    | Provides information about the client making the request.                                 |

<Note>
   When the **Authorization and Content-Type** values are set through their respective sections, the description fields in their auto-generated headers are disabled for manual input, leaving the value empty. In contrast, for **Inherited** headers, the specified values are automatically populated in the description fields. 
</Note>

wso2apisuite offers a variety of header options beyond these five examples, allowing you to customize how the server processes your requests to meet specific requirements.

### Bulk edit request headers

Using the  <Icon icon="pen-to-square" iconType="solid" />  **Bulk edit** feature in wso2apisuite's request headers tab, you can input and manage multiple headers simultaneously, with each header on a new line and the key and value separated by a **colon (:)**. For example,

```yaml
Authorization: Bearer token123
Content-Type: application/json
# User-Agent: CustomAgent/1.0
```
